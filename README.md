# Battleboats !

My take on the classic game of Battleships but in a terminal.

This site is **not** tablet or mobile responsive.

## Design

### Workflow :

![Flowchart image](/readme-images/flowchart.png)

### Users pov :

This does not belong in this project but i changed some colors on the live site and gave the run program button a new margin just to make it a little easier on the eyes.
For this i used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/)
![Color palette](/readme-images/colorspace-palette.png)

0. At the top you will see a simple "logo" in both the menu and in the game screen but **not** in rule book.

1. This is what you will experience when you start this program
    * You will see a menu with three choices.
      * Use the **Arrow** keys to **navigate** and **Enter** key on your keyboard to **Select**.
        * These "arrows" **> <** will show you where you are in the menu. 
        
      * Menu options :
        * Easy Mode starts the game with 15 Turns.
        * Hard Mode starts the game with 10 turns.
        * Rule Book leads to a page that only shows the rules.

2. This is what you will see when you have selected either **Easy mode** or **Hard Mode** (except for Turn) in the menu.
    * The controls.
    * Reminders of what the "graphics" mean.
    * The statistics of what has happened so far in the game.
    * The gamespace.
      * The gamespace is five columns and five rows big.
        * The cursor/sight is a plus sign and starts in the center of the gamespace. 
        * You can "shoot" anywhere in the gamespace using the **Arrow keys** and **Space key**.
        * When "shot" the stats will change and the gamespace will be updated.
        * If you shoot in the same spot twice or press an invalid button you will get a message and "Turn" will **not** update.
        * Rinse and repeat and you will eventually win or lose.
          * When you win or lose the cursor/sight will dissappear to reveal the full gamespace and you will be greeted a message and prompted to press the **Enter key**
            * When **Enter key** is pressed you go back to the menu.

3. This is what you will see when you have selected **Rule Book** in the menu.
    * The game controls and rules.
    * A message that prompts you to press **Enter key** to go back to the menu.

4. You have the freedom to check the rules or play the game as many times as you like.
